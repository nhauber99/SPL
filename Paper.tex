\begin{abstract}
With growing complexity of software systems, variability of said has become an increasing problem and managing it is thus a crucial part of the present-day software engineering process. It is particularly vital if either many product versions make use of an existing architecture over a long period of time or if a variety of software systems share a common code base. The focus of this paper is to provide an overview of how variation in software systems is caused, how it influences the development process and how it can be dealt with.

\section{Introduction}
Here we are going to introduce the reader into the broad environment

\section{Background and related work}
In this section the background research which we use to present an overview of the topic.

\section{Origin of variability}
We introduce why there is variability in the modern software engineering process. So that the reader knows how the problems arrise to have a baseline for presenting solutions for said problems.

\section{Variability modeling}
The question we want to answer in this section how one can model/describe the changes the software architecture is exposed to and how the dependencies and flexibility can be put into a defined state.

\section{Variability patterns}
Sums up the typical patterns how variability can be introduced.
(1/2 page, maybe merge with section above) NH

\section{???Variability planning???}
Gives an overview of how someone can plan for varability and how to manage it.

\section{Discussion/Challenges}
Discuss why the variability of systems is hard to tackle and why it is not always successful.

\section{Conclussion}
Make final remarks about the discussed elements.
